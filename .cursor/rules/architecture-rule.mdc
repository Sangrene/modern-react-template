Architecture of the project: which file to reuse, how to link React with the hexagon, how to reuse UI components

- When adding a basic HTML component (Button, Dropdown, Select, Input etc...) to a component, always try to use a component from /app/components. If a basic component is missing, ask to create one with its dedicated storybook .stories.tsx file.
- Core files shouldn't depend directly on anything besides interfaces. Every dependency should be injected in the core. You can see an example in /src/user/user.core.ts and /src/user/features/updateCurrentUser/updateCurrentUser.core.ts.
- Core files should always be tested, in isolation. They should depend on injected dependency, instead of direct dependency.
