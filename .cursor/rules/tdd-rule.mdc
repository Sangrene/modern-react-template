# Test Driven Development
When developing a feature, apply a TDD rules. Only *.core and *.view-model files should be automatically tested. 

## Steps
When writing core and view-model code, you should loop between the following steps :
- Write a failing test matching one of the feature use case.
- Write the code making this failing test pass.
- Test that the failing test is now passing.

## Test in isolation
When testing core files, the tests should be in total isolation. As the core are not dependant on external dependencies but rather on interface, you can create the fake interfaces to make the test pass.

## Don't test existing libraries or implementation details
The tests should only test the code logic itself, from the caller point of view, not an external library or the internal of the core or view-model. The only that should be tested are the real use cases of these files, what is exposed (data or functions).
